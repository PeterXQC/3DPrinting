# Welcome to Peter's 3D Printing Notes

Hello! I'm Peter, and I love 3D printing—especially with my Voron 2.4. This website is dedicated to documenting my journey in modifying, enhancing, and optimizing my 3D printer.

Whether you're here to explore specific projects I've completed or you're looking for inspiration and guidance to achieve your own printing goals, I hope you find this resource helpful.

## How This Website Is Organized

This website is organized by **specific printing goals or intentions**, such as speed, accuracy, robustness, etc. Within each intention, you'll find:

1. **Overview:** A brief explanation of factors affecting that specific intention (e.g., what affects printing speed or accuracy).
2. **Projects and Mods:** Individual projects detailing specific modifications or upgrades I implemented to work towards these goals.

Additionally, I may include notes, experiences, challenges, and solutions within each project page.

I strive to maintain this structure, but if something seems out of place, please use the search feature to quickly locate content.

## Acknowledgements

I'd like to express my gratitude to [Andrew Ellis](https://ellis3dp.com) for the invaluable information provided on his website, as well as for inspiring this documentation effort.

## Continuous Improvement

Like my printers, this website will always remain a work in progress. I continually update it as I experiment and learn new things. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

Happy printing!

— Peter
