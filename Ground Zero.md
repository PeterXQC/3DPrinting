# Ground Zero

3D printing has always fascinated me, but it wasn't until early 2024 that I discovered my true passion lies with the printers themselves. This realization led me to purchase a Voron 2.4 kit from Formbot. You might find that a Voron 2.4's flying gantry misaligns with many goals throughout this page. To that, I quote

> “Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always long to return.” ― Leonardo da Vinci 

I completed assembling my Voron 2.4 in Q3 of 2024. This printer now serves as the foundational reference—the "ground truth"—for all my subsequent projects, modifications, and enhancements documented on this site.
