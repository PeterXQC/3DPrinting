# Ground Zero

3D printing has always fascinated me, but it wasn't until early 2024 that I discovered my true passion lies with the printers themselves. This realization led me to purchase a Voron 2.4 kit from Formbot. You might find that a Voron 2.4's flying gantry misaligns with many goals throughout this page. To that, I quote

> “Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always long to return.” ― Leonardo da Vinci 

I completed assembling my Voron 2.4 in Q3 of 2024. This printer now serves as the foundational reference—the "ground truth"—for all my subsequent projects, modifications, and enhancements documented on this site.

The official documentation starts in Q3 of 2025. At this point, I modified my voron to use the following non-stock parts.

| Part | List |
| -------- | ------- |
| Extruder | Orbiter V2.0 |
| Hotend | Rapido V2 UHF |
| XY-Motors | LDO 42STH48-2804AH |
| X_axis beam | Carbon fiber beam from Mellow |
| PSU | 48V for XY-plane motors, 24V for rest |
| Parts fan  | biqu Cpap kit |

I have installed the following mods.

- [Front Idlers](https://github.com/Ramalama2/Voron-2-Mods/tree/main/Front_Idlers)
- [Toolhead](https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/Xol-Toolhead)
    - [I modified this file to use a 3030 fan (and sacrificed the LEDs) for better hot end cooling.](https://www.printables.com/model/959706-xol2-with-3010-hotend-fan-and-heat-set-inserts/comments)
- [Panel Latches](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/main/printer_mods/richardjm/snap-latch-2020)
- [Nozzle Brush](https://www.printables.com/model/786705-voron-24-nozzle-brush-using-bambu-labs-a1-silicone)
    - Print this with material with higer "glass temperature", as it is in close proximity to the heat bed. 
    - Silicone nozzle brushes doesnt fling materials everywhere, as a traditional brass brush would.

Now, may the journey begin!
