# Welcome to Peter's 3D Printing Notes

Hello! I'm Peter, and I love 3D printing—especially with my Voron 2.4. This website is dedicated to documenting my journey in modifying, enhancing, and optimizing my 3D printer.

Whether you're here to explore specific projects I've completed or you're looking for inspiration and guidance to achieve your own printing goals, I hope you find this resource helpful.

## Acknowledgements

I'd like to express my gratitude to [Andrew Ellis](https://ellis3dp.com) for the invaluable information provided on his website, as well as for inspiring this documentation effort.

## Continuous Improvement

Like my printers, this website will always remain a work in progress. I continually update it as I experiment and learn new things. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

Happy printing!

— Peter
