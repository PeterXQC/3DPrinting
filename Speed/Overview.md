# Overview

I don't imagine anyone truly **needs** to print a Benchy in under three minutes. However, having the ability to do so is cool, particularly when you can effortlessly switch between different slicer profiles. In this section, my goal is to maximize the printer's speed without introducing mechanical limitations that compromise print quality. My standard is that the printer must remain accurate when using moderate, practical slicer settings.

Jokes aside, I found that most of the time the speed of a print is not limited by the motion system. At the end of the day, regardless of how fast you can fling that toolhead, plastic needs to be melt at a matching rate. There are few factors relating to the ability a toolhead has to melt plastics. 

### Extruder
Assuming that your hotend is capable, you need to push plastic through it as fast as possible. Your extruder need to grab onto the filament well and shove it into the hotend hard.  That said, in my experience, as long as the maximum speed of
